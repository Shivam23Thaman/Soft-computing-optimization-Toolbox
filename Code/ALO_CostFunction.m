% The default name of the objective function is CostFunction.
% If you have a look at the CostFunction.m file, you may notice
% that the cost function gets the variables in a vector ([x1 x2 ... xn]) and
% returns the objective value. You can either write you objective function
% in this file or create a new file and pass its name to the toolbox.
% Remember to follow the same structure for input and output if you decided 
% to go for the second option. 

function Cost = CostFunction( x )
dim=size(x,2);
Cost=sum(x.^2); % Sphere function
