# Soft-computing-optimization-Toolbox(S.C.O.T)
What it does:

1.A Toolbox that incorporates Six optimization algorithms under a single umbrella.
2.Individual GUIÂ’s for each and every algorithm.
3.Graphical representations of the results.

How to run:

Steps:

1. Open MATLAB
2. Open the Code folder containing all the required files.
3. Open the mastergui.m file
4. Click on Run
5. Click on any of the push-button to launch a particular algorithm GUI.

Following are the steps to run different algorithms:
1.PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization):

Select different functions from Function Drop down list.
Select type of optimization (minimization/maximization).
Click on 'Plot it!'(2D and 3D graph  will be plotted)

After plot it:
You can change the different parameters(Geneartion limit, Population Size, Precision)
Velocity factors can also be changed
Click on Run (Simulation will start)

For all other algorithms(GWO/SCA/MVO/WAO/ALO):

You can change the following parameters(if you want to):
Number of particles
Number of iterations
Lower Bound and Upper Bound
Number of varibles
Objective Function (Write it in coste function file)

By selecting search history:
Past reslts will be stored and shown simutaneously.

Click on 'Start Optimization' (Graphical Simulation begins)
Results will be displayed
